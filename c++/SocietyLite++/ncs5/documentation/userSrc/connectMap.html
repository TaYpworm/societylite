    <H2>Connect Maps in NCS</H2>

    <IMG src="images/connect.png" align=right>

    After synaptic connections have been made, NCS can output a data file
    containing a map of connections between the various cell clusters in the simulation.
    
    This file will be named job.synapse.dat, where "job" is the name given in the JOB field
    of the Brain Block.
    
    <H3>File Format</H3>
        
    Source Names( Column, Layer, Cell, Compartment )<BR>
    Destination Names( Column, Layer, Cell, Compartment )<BR>
    Synapse Name<BR>
    Source Quantity Destination Quantity<BR>
    Connection Matrix<BR>
    
    <H3>Connection Matrix</H3>
    
    <P>The connections are laid out in a matrix format.  The columns correspond to
    source cells while the rows correspond to the destination cells.  Entries will either
    be a zero (0) or a one (1), where zero represents no connection between the cells while
    a one represents a connection.  Note: The source and destination clusters may represent
    the same cluster.  If that is the case, a single cell will not be allowed to connect to
    itself.
