Notes concerning generating the user documentation
--------------------------------------------------

The documentation can be generated using the Makefile by invoking

make docs

This will go into the directory: "documentation" and invoke a perl script.
This script will take templates and data in the subdirectory "userSrc" to
generate HTML pages which will be written to the subdirectory "userDoc"

Required User Interaction
--------------------------------------------------

This build instruction is not completely self sufficient, yet.  To generate
the documentation correctly, one file must be edited to specify the
complete path to the documentation source files.

This file is "userSrc/global.variables"

There will be a line that looks similar to:

#workingdir<=>/home/username/ncs/documentation/userSrc/<;>

change the path to the current location, save the file, and then go back and invoke
make docs.  

After generation
--------------------------------------------------

After generating the documents, they can be uploaded to a server and viewed
through any web browser.
